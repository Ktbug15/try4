<p class="tennismargin">
    When I was younger, I saw all my peers who all had their "thing". I had spent most of my childhood trying so many 
    different sports but I never seemed to excel at any of them. Basketball was the sport I clung to the most. In fact, 
    I spent hours and hours alone trying to improve my skill. I gave 100% every practice but to no avail. I was benched 
    almost every game. After going through this cycle again and again seeing no fruit of my labor, I decided to put my 
    efforts into something else, Tennis. 
</p> 

<h4 class="tennismargin underline" id="fulfillingmypotential">Fulfilling My Potential</h4>
<p class="tennismargin">
    When I started playing Tennis, I could barely consider myself coordinated. My shots went everywhere, my grip was extremely 
    unnatural, and my footwork and ball placement was worthy of a laugh. But seeing what potential there was, I locked in and 
    started practicing. I remained committed from day 1 that I was going to work as hard as I could because when I played, I 
    fell in love. Over time and through diligent practice, I was able to place #3 Singles for my High School Tennis Team. I 
    had finally made it. There was nothing like it.
</p>

<h4 class="tennismargin underline" id="overcomingsetbacks">Overcoming Setbacks</h4>
<p class="tennismargin">
    As with any success story, there are setbacks. The summer before my senior year, I was in a serious car accident which left 
    me broken, on the outside and inside. My right wrist was broken, and I had bruises all over my entire body. I had torn nerves 
    in my knee causing irreprable damage. I was devastated. I had worked so hard to get to where I was and I was planning to practice
    all summer to be ready for my last season of tennis and it seemed all was lost. 
</p>

<p class="tennismargin">Well, 2 weeks after my surgery, I got back on the court. Unable to run without getting dizzy, I walked around trying to be a part
    of all the drills and playing with my left hand. I did what I could while knowing my likelyhood of playing varsity singles was slim. 
    But I came to practice every morning of the summer, learning how to play all over again. Tryouts came two weeks after I got my cast off
    and I was praying for one thing, that I would just be able to play--and play without pain.
</p>

<h4 class="tennismargin underline" id="storytotell">A Story to Tell</h4>
<p class="tennismargin">
    Tryouts came and I witnessed a miracle. I was playing against a varsity level player, and as I swung, I could actually hit the ball! Though
    I lost that match, I was blown away that I could hit the ball with my arm, use power, and feel no pain. The fire was back. Well, I played
    for the rest of tryouts feeling somewhat confident in my abilities and when the roster came out, I got the very last spot on varsity. I 
    was absolutely thrilled. I knew it was divine intervention. As the season progressed, my partner and I kept winning match after match after 
    match. And the time came for the region championship, and we won. This victory to me would not have been nearly as significant. I was shown
    that comebacks are more rewarding than just regular old success.  
</p>

<h4 class="tennismargin underline" id="coaching">Coaching</h4>
<p class="tennismargin">Being mentored by a coach who believed in me changed my life. Unlike in basketball, where my coaches picked their favorites 
    and only played to win, my tennis coach let everyone have an opportunity to play. He gave everyone a chance to improve. He saw our potential. I 
    have since taken up coaching. I cherish the opportunity to watch these young tennis players grow. I get to help them see the potential I see in 
    them. I truly believe each kid I coach has the potential to be incredible because I remember how "skilled" I was when I started. Effort and belief 
    can accomplish incredible things </p>

<h4 class="tennismargin underline" id="whatilearned">What I've Learned</h4>
<p class="tennismargin">At the end of the day, Tennis is just a sport. I spend hours watching professional tennis players (shown above), wondering sometimes why people spend
    their whole lives learning how to hit a small yellow ball over a net, and then I realize that's what I've been doing. But tennis has taught me so much
    more than that. I have learned that there is no point in skill if we are not mentally in the right place. I have learned that it is possible to 
    accomplish whatever I truly set my mind to. I learned that how we view ourselves is important. Lastly, I've
